Conferences Are Tough
I think we can all agree that conferences can be overwhelming. For someone whose senses are on over or underdrive, it can be a confusing and disorienting environment. Below are some tipds for both attendees and conference organizers to make it an inclusive and welcoming space for all.

Spaces
Block off a room and label it "Desensitization Room" for people to go when overwhelmed. It can contain blankets, soft lighting, earplus, and cushions. Above all, it should be minimal and quiet.

Accomodations
- earplugs available
- seating by the door
- perhaps some people can wear the "sunflower lanyard" to indiciate invisible disability if need be
- pre-planning with any volunteers/TAs who cannot commit as much time as others due to their disability (if people abuse this, they're real jerks!)
- volunteer/TA training (even simple things, like how to give directions to someone with a disability)
- general awareness around crowded spaces, traffic flow, speaker volume, etc.
- signs directing to the Desensitization Room
Tip: Ask peopel if your services worked for them, or what you could improve on next time. Let's do this, together!

Social
Some people really don't like being touched. Normalize this by mentioning an inclusive outlook at the beginning of the conference. Most people handshake without thinking, but some conferences even have a sticker you can wear to ask people to refrain from touching you. It's also great for immuno-compromised people. Next try to be aware of crowd-averse people who still want to network and "party". Where can they meet? How is it facilitated? How can they get the most out of the conference without being dragged to a rave?
Tip: The more we talk about different needs, the more people will feel comfortable advocating for themselves.

Conclusion
Diversity is what makes science happen. Some of these things might be a bit weird, and maybe you've never practices them before. But that's what is so wonderful about a community; we learn together and help each other grow.
